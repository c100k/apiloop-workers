# Apiloop Workers

![Workers](resources/workers.png)

## Overview

This library was part of the [Apiloop](https://www.apiloop.io) platform (_now shutdown_ ðŸ˜­). 

It defines a set of [workers](src/main/java/io/apiloop/workers/base/Worker.java) that were usable in the workflows.

For each [BusinessObject](src/main/java/io/apiloop/workers/base/BusinessObject.java) that you had in your data model (User, Post, etc..)
you could hook on lifecycle events (on create, on delete, on update, etc.) to perform specific actions.
 
These actions had an entry predicate (whether to execute it or not) and a worker.

The job of the worker is simple : *do one thing, and do it well*.

## Workers

Here is a list of the workers currently implemented. The workers were implemented on demand, but the idea is to add more and more.
